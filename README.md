# Command Pattern Tutorial
Java example implementation of the command pattern with interfaces.

In this example, the `Main` class creates a list of three `Command` objects, each of which implements the `Command` interface. Then, it executes 10 random commands on a `User`, changing various properties of the user.

# Abstract Class Tutorial
A java example explaining the use of an abstract class in the context of making a small university database.
The classes involved are namely: `Human.java` representing the abstract class, `Student.java` representing the student we would want in our database. A small `Enum.java` was made to distinguish between the two genders and of course the `Main.java` class to instantiate the object and print its attributes.
